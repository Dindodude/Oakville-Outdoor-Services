          <h3>🛟 Safety & Quality</h3>
          <p>
            We work carefully around vehicles, curbs, porches, and gardens to prevent damage. During heavy storms,
            we wait until roads are safe enough to travel, then work efficiently to reach every home as quickly as possible.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:8px;">
            Salting is available on request to help reduce ice and improve safety. We aim to clear snow as close to the surface
            as conditions safely allow.
