          <h3>👤 Idrees – Owner & Operator</h3>
          <p>
            Oakville Outdoor Service is run by Idrees, a local student who started this business to offer reliable,
            straightforward snow removal for families, neighbours, and small businesses in Oakville.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:8px;">
            The goal is to combine professional communication with hard work: clear pricing, quick responses, and showing up when promised.
            Every job is treated with care, whether it’s a single driveway or multiple visits over the winter.

          <h3>🛟 Safety & Quality</h3>
          <p>
            Safety matters — for you and for us. We wait until roads are safe enough to travel, especially during heavy storms,
            and we work carefully around vehicles, curbs, and garden edges.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:8px;">
            Where requested, salting helps reduce ice and slips. We aim to clear snow as close to the surface as conditions safely allow,
            without damaging your property. If anything is ever missed, you can reach out and we’ll work to make it right.
